Section Builder
===============

By `Lex Li`_

The shortcut is ``ctrl+k ctrl+=`` (on Mac ``cmd+k cmd+=``).

Pressing the shortcut key would convert the current line under the cursor to
a section, by adding adornment (underlines below the title text).

Pressing the shortcut key multiple times switches among the adornment
characters.
